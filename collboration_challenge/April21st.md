# Organization and Getting Started

Well organized projects are successful projects. They are easier to share and get help when you are stuck. They last longer and make more impact. We will work both on the kaggle website and locally to learn skills.

* Clone the website git repo 

https://weecology.github.io/AI_for_ecology_workshop/

* Download the kaggle data and register on kaggle

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2025

* Create a new folder with your group name

* In this folder, create a requirements.txt file, README.md file and a jupyter notebook file.

* Commit and push this to github. 

* On kaggle website, look or the Medellín Workshop notebook

## Look at your data!

It is very easy to just start building models and making predictions. Its fun, its rewarding and it is a bad idea. Study your data carefully and for a long time. Play with it, and learn about it from a computer science *and* biological angle.

Find a species, describe its call and drop an image here to practice your markdown skills.

One fo the great dangers, which I have seen many times, is that machine learning peopel don't understand the needs and outputs for of the biology team. It happens all the time. No progress can be made unless your work is reproduciple, clean, and as simple as possible. At every step ask yourself, do I need to do this, what is the simplest thing I can do to achieve my aims. Do not get distracted by shiny things. 

## Questions

How many classes in the taxonomy file?

What species will be easy, hard?

What do you think will be the hardests parts of organizing this dataset?

What are the machine learning challenges?
